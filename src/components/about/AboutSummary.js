    <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
      I started my journey in Computer Science with a curiosity to understand how technology works
      and how we can use it to solve real-world problems. Currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology
      in Computer Science at Amity University Jharkhand, I've developed a strong foundation in both
      theoretical concepts and practical applications.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
      My passion lies in full-stack web development, where I can combine my knowledge of frontend
      technologies like React and backend frameworks like Node.js and FastAPI to create comprehensive
      solutions. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and staying up-to-date with the latest
      technologies and best practices.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-600">
      When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, working on personal projects,
      or contributing to the developer community. I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges
      that push my technical boundaries.
